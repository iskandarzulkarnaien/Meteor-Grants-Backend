Tests for API 4 & 5

Note: API 5 is essentially a restricted version of API 4, which returns only the valid family members rather than the entire household

Therefore, we can use these tests to check that API 4 correctly returns valid households when passed multiple search parameters
(in the form of the various grant criteria)

These tests can also be used to check API 5 by passing a flag to indicate to return only the valid family members
